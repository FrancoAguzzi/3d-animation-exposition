# 🎯 3D Interactive Animation Showcase

Hey there! 👋  
This repository was crafted with care by **Franco Camelo Aguzzi** for a special [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franco-from-crystal/) to showcase how simple it is to create interactive 3D elements in websites, powered by **Atropos**, the amazing 3D hover effect library 🚀

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

This is a **minimal, clean, and effective** implementation of [Atropos.js](https://atroposjs.com/) — no fluff, just a fast way to see its magic in action ✨

Whether you're a dev exploring Atropos for the first time, or someone who loves smooth 3D UI effects, this project shows how to:

- 🎨 Create animated, interactive elements with depth
- ⚙️ Integrate Atropos with ease
- 💡 Learn by example (clean code, small footprint)

## 💻 Quick Start

Clone the repo and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrancoAguzzi/3d-interactive-animation.git
